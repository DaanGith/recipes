    5 g Parmesan cheese
    olive oil
    1 tablespoon cottage cheese

Method
Boil the kettle. Cut the lasagne sheets in half lengthways, then into 2cm strips, using a crinkle-cut knife, 
if you’ve got one. Trim the spring onions and finely chop with the spinach and half the salmon. 
Finely grate the lemon zest, then the Parmesan, keeping them separate. Put a 28cm frying pan on a high heat.
