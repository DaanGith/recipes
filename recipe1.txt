Recipe Smoked salmon pasta for one

Spinach, spring onion, lemon, curds & Parmesan


Ingredients

    125 g fresh lasagne sheets
    2 spring onions
    80 g spinach
    60 g smoked salmon (2 slices)
    ½ a lemon
    5 g Parmesan cheese
    olive oil
    1 tablespoon cottage cheese
    optional: extra virgin olive oil

    Method
Once hot, put a little drizzle of olive oil into the pan with the spring onions, spinach, chopped salmon and lemon zest. 
Scatter the pasta into the pan, then carefully pour in enough boiling kettle water to just cover the pasta – about 250ml. 
Let it bubble away for 4 minutes, or until the pasta has absorbed most of the water and you’ve got a nice sauce, 
stirring regularly and loosening with an extra splash of water, if needed. Turn the heat off, squeeze in the lemon juice, 
stir in the cottage cheese and Parmesan, then season to perfection. 
Delicately tear over the remaining salmon, and finish with a kiss of extra virgin olive oil, if you like.
