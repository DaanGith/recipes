Cheesecake should never be a source of anything except pure bliss. Not distress. Not frustration. Certainly never tears. Just dreamy, decadent, nonstop bliss.

So let’s break down this whole process into easy pieces. Let’s talk about ingredients, water baths, dealing with surface cracks — the whole shebang. Here’s a step-by-step recipe that will help you make a creamy, no-fail cheesecake that is everything you ever dreamed it could be. 


Three whole eggs
Cream cheese
Sour cream
1 bowl of strawberries
some sugar
500g flower
0.25l water
A water bath is also not that hard:

1 Wrap the cheesecake pan in foil to help keep any water from seeping through the cracks of the pan.
2 Set the cheesecake in a roasting pan or other large baking dish.
3 Fill it with a few inches of water, and put the whole contraption in the oven.
