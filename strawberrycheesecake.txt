Three whole eggs
Cream cheese
Sour cream
1 bowl of strawberries
some sugar
500g flower
0.25l water
A water bath is also not that hard:

1 Wrap the cheesecake pan in foil to help keep any water from seeping through the cracks of the pan.
2 Set the cheesecake in a roasting pan or other large baking dish.
3 Fill it with a few inches of water, and put the whole contraption in the oven.
