Halloumi eggy crumpets

Cherry tomato, lime & avocado salsa & a runny fried egg

Ingredients

    2 large free-range eggs
    2 crumpets
    80 g ripe mixed-colour cherry tomatoes
    1 teaspoon hot chilli sauce
    ½ a lime
    2 sprigs of coriander
    ¼ of a small ripe avocado
    olive oil
    8 g halloumi cheese


Method
Beat one egg in a shallow bowl, then add the crumpets to soak on both sides. 
To make the salsa, quarter the tomatoes, then mix in a small bowl with the chilli sauce and a squeeze of lime juice. 
Season to perfection, then pick over the coriander leaves. Peel, chop and add the avocado, ready to toss just before serving.

Put a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with 1 teaspoon of olive oil. 
Crack in the remaining egg, then add the crumpets alongside, and cover. Flip the crumpets when golden, and cook the egg to your liking. 
Move it all to your plate, then quickly coarsely grate the halloumi into the pan. Toss the salsa and spoon over the crumpets. 
Once the halloumi is golden, use a fish slice to nudge it loose and flip it proudly over your plate, golden side up. 
Finish with extra chilli sauce, if you like.
